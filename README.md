# broadcast-website
A broadcast application, just for fun and self use. frontend-backend separation. using SRS, ffmpeg, mpegts.js

## Empty Repository
Although the website is already in use, some features have yet to be implemented, and parts of the code need refactoring. So, I've placed a README here for now. I've published a post about this on my blog, see the link: [Blog：24h automatic live boardcast website](https://abcde1477.github.io/2024/09/06/develop-live-website/)

## 空仓库
虽然网站已经实际投入使用了，但是因为一些功能没有实现，部分代码也需要重构。所以先放了个README在这里。我的博客发布了这个推文，见此链接：[博客：24h自动化直播网站](https://abcde1477.github.io/2024/09/06/develop-live-website/)
